        Manacells The Road to DNA Amplification
The patientsâ€™ blood is collected through one of the peripheral veins like the cubital vein, using a vacutainer and needle, this already contains EDTA, thus the blood does not clot. Then it is centrifuged at 200G so that the RBCs can be taken away and all we need is the top in between layer called the buffy coat and the plasma. The buffy coat is rich in WBCs which are the nucleated cells of the blood that means it contains DNA and is capable of producing proteins that the body may need. When this buffy coat rich in WBCs is seen under the light of a microscope the cells are varied in shape with spicules on its surface which are the protein markers that gives it identification and its allergic properties.
